OOB Automated Testing is a scoped app to capture tests for all the Out of Box 
servicenow applications.  With this you have a place to start your own tests 
instead of starting from scratch.  Once installed you'll be able to run a batch
of tests against the instance.  One key detail about all of these tests, they
are all self-contained.  Meaning, you don't need to load up any demo users,
companies or groups to try these tests.  They are all included in this scoped
application.

## Installation

If you just want to try it out, follow these steps;

1. Due to this being a Scoped Application, to make this work with simplifying 
   tests, one modification must be made in Global Scope.  On 
   `/sys_db_object.do?sysparm_query=name=sys_user_group`
   under "Application Access", check "Can create", "Can update", "Can delete", 
   and save.

2. Import `https://github.com/jacebenson/atf.git` to source control 
   within Studio.

## Usage

After it's installed you can run the tests by going to Test Suites, OOB Tests
and then run it.  

### Features

Below is the desired organization of test suites.  Some of these are closed 
because there is no good way to test things.  Some of these are closed because
someone has done some of the work.  As work continues I'll add notes to these
issues.  A key feature of these tests is that they are all self contained.
Meaning they rely on no outside data.

## Resources

* If you need to `set fields` but cannot find 
  you're field, this script might be useful;
  ```js
  var gr = new GlideRecord('sys_atf_step');
  gr.get('f1a43c15db0123008096a455ca961915');
  var fields = gr.inputs.field_values.toString();
  gs.info(fields);
  fields = fields.replace('^EQ','^kb_knowledge_base=dfc19531bf2021003f07e2c1ac0739ab^EQ');
  gs.info(fields);
  gr.inputs.field_values = fields;
  gr.update();
  ```
